# Exercise

Step 1: Load insurancedata package, using data() to load data dataCar and explore the dataset, explore the difference between numclaims and clm using table().

Step 2: Build a frequency table(i.e. no of claims / exposure) by factors (e.g. veh_age); Convert data type for veh_age to factor using as.factor.

Step 3: Using ggplot2 to draw some bar charts : e.g. exploring the relationship between claim frequency(clm/exposure) and veh_age and agecat, and explore whether the pattern is the same for male/female. 

Step 4: Fitting a glm to claim frequency using chosen factors, e.g. veh_body,veh_age,gender,area.
